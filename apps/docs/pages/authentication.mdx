# ðŸ”’ Authentication

T4 uses [networkless token verification](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/node/networkless-token-verification) to verify the identity of the user.

## ðŸ”­ Overview

Networkless token verification is a method used to authenticate and verify
the identity of a user without relying on network connectivity. This method was
chosen because it enables near zero latency overhead for authentication checks on the server.

The Cloudflare Workers API server indeed uses the Clerk service for user authentication. However, it does not directly call the Clerk's API as you might expect. Instead, it uses the `@tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt` library to verify the JWT (JSON Web Token) that is issued by Clerk when a user logs in.

## ðŸŒŠ Here's a brief overview of the flow:

1. A user logs in using Clerk and receives a JWT.

2. When the user makes a request to the Cloudflare Workers server, this JWT is sent along in the Authorization header.

3. The `@tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt` library on the server extracts and verifies the token, ensuring that it is correctly signed and hasn't expired.

4. If the token is valid, the request proceeds; otherwise, it is rejected.
