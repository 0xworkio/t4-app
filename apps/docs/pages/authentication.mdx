# ðŸ”’ Authentication - Clerk

T4 uses [networkless token verification](https://clerk.com/docs/reference/node/networkless-token-verification) to verify the identity of the user.

## ðŸ”­ Overview

Networkless token verification is a method used to authenticate and verify
the identity of a user without relying on network connectivity. This method was
chosen because it enables near zero latency overhead for authentication checks on the server.

The Cloudflare Workers API server indeed uses the Clerk service for user authentication. However, it does not directly call the Clerk's API as you might expect. Instead, it uses the `@tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt` library to verify the JWT (JSON Web Token) that is issued by Clerk when a user logs in.

## ðŸŒŠ Here's a brief overview of the flow:

1. A user logs in using Clerk and receives a JWT.

2. When the user makes a request to the Cloudflare Workers server, this JWT is sent along in the Authorization header.

3. The `@tsndr/cloudflare-worker-jwt` library on the server extracts and verifies the token, ensuring that it is correctly signed and hasn't expired.

4. If the token is valid, the request proceeds; otherwise, it is rejected.

# ðŸ”’ Authentication - Supabase

T4 uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) for authentication

## ðŸ”­ Overview

The authentication flow in T4 involves the following steps:

1. User Registration: Users can register their accounts using Supabase's email authentication
   or sign in directly through various third-party providers such as Google, Apple, and Discord.
   This allows users to choose their preferred method for signing up.

2. Email Verification: After registering, users receive an email to verify their email address.
   They need to click on the verification link to confirm their account.

3. User Login: Once registered and verified, users can log in to T4 using Supabase's email authentication
   or directly through third-party providers.

4. Password Recovery: If users forget their password, they can initiate a
   password recovery process. Supabase will send them an email with
   instructions on how to reset their password.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Once a user is authenticated, T4 utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
to manage and maintain user sessions. The JWT contains encoded information about the
user's identity and authentication details. This token is securely stored on the
client side (e.g., in secure storage or cookies) and sent with each request to
authenticate and authorize the user's access to protected resources.

Authorization and Access Control: Along with authentication, T4 implements authorization and
access control mechanisms. This includes managing user roles, permissions, and restrictions
to ensure appropriate access to specific resources or features based on the user's privileges.
