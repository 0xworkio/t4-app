# ðŸ¤” Frequently Asked Questions

## Why no Auth.js / NextAuth.js support?

NextAuth.js is web only, unfortunately.

[See this Github issue](https://github.com/timothymiller/t4-app/issues/16) for a discussion on the topic.

## Why Cloudflare D1?

In anticipation of D1 reaching a stable release soon, I've decided to use it as the default database for this project.

D1 is a great option for a few reasons:

- It's free, with the lowest costs for additional storage
- It's fast (low latency)
- It's serverless
- It's easy to use

Drizzle + D1 is a great combination for a serverless app.

In the meantime, Cloudflare R2 integration is easier than ever. The bulk of your data storage usage will likely take place in R2.

## Why no Prisma support?

Prisma is not supported in Cloudflare Workers because it's a chunky boi in terms of bundle size.

## Supabase warning logged in local dev

If you see this warning in your console when running `pnpm web`. You can safely ignore it.

```bash
No storage option exists to persist the session, which may result in unexpected behavior when using auth.
If you want to set persistSession to true, please provide a storage option or you may set persistSession to false to disable this warning.
```

## Can Expo SDK libraries be used for React Native?

Absolutely! You can use any Expo SDK libraries you want.

### Understanding the file structure of T4 App

For code within the `/packages/app` directory, you can target both web, native, or both at the same time.

#### How targeting React platforms works in T4 App

For a given file name,

- `.native.tsx` targets Expo/React Native
- `.web.tsx` targets Next.js/React
- `.tsx` is shared across both

Using this approach, T4 app can share as much code as possible between web and native, while still allowing for platform specific code.
